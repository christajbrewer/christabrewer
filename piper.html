<p> In February 2021, I adopted a 3-year-old dachshund wire-haired terrier mix from Bastrop, Texas. Ever since then, she has stole my heart! Fun story about Piper, my parents briefly lived in Bastrop when I was an infant but eventually moved onto their next adventure. We had a outdoor cat then, named by our neighbors at the time as Precious. Fast foward to my freshman year of college, Piper was originally named as 'Precious' by the shelter I adopted her from - once again, in Bastrop.</p>

<p> At first, she was terrified of humans and other dogs. Now, she has grown into loving other dogs and (mostly) people. Unfortunately, she is still very much afraid of children. Her silly and sweet personality has truly blossomed, and I am so grateful to have experienced the whole journey with her. There is so much joy that comes with knowing her, and I never thought I'd be one of <i>"those"</i> pet parents who love to tell the whole life story of their dog but here we are!</p>

<p> Fun fact! As a part of their retirement, my parents own a farm full of animals. My mother loves to take care of them and treats them as her babies. The one you see below is Padme. In recent months, she passed away from a birth defect. Padme is very, very loved in our family as she was a bottle fed baby. Some of our sheep have also been bottle fed, so it just adds to the already present love to watch them grow. </p>
