<p> Likely inherited from my mother, I have a passion for gardening. I find joy in caring for plants and observing their unique growth and blooming processes. Some of my favorites are cilantro, aloe vera and my mother's plum trees. Although I am still a beginner, I enjoy reading about plants and experimenting with different techniques. The picture in the middle above was taken at Victorian Sample Florist, a local family-owned business. My family and I enjoy the hobby of exploring antique shops.</p>
<p> Going to the library has been one of my favorite activites since childhood. To no surpise, my favorite hobby is reading. I enjoy anything from educational or non-fiction to mystery and romance. Recently, I've set a goal to read at least 10 pages a day. My favorite place to read is at the park, beach, or river. During my studies, I took criminology and juveline deliquency classes, which introduced me to some fascinating books. </p>
<p>Below, you will see a little bit more facts about me.</p>
