<div id="section">
<p> As a part of a team, I have worked on communications campaigns for the Texas Department of Transportation, The Great Springs project in Travis County and TXST Student Involvement and Engagement. The importance of these experiences was to produce compelling PR strategies, create content graphics, and study analytics for the success of the organizations.
Below, you will find past projects for college courses.
