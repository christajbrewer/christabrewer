<p> Hi there! I'm Christa Brewer, and welcome to my second attempt at building an HTML website. On this site, you'll find a showcase of both past and ongoing projects, as well as insights into my background and interests. </p>	

<p> As a recent graduate of Texas State University, my academic journey has been both challenging and rewarding. One highlight has been interacting with a diverse range of individuals and learning about their unique goals and aspirations. I am continually inspired by the dedication of those around me, whether fellow students, service workers, or professionals across various fields, each forging their own path. On August 3rd, 2024, I earned my Bachelor of Science in Public Relations with a minor in Sociology. </p>

<p> I am deeply grateful to those who have inspired me, my professors, old friends, and even brief, meaningful interactions with strangers. Most importantly, I'm grateful for my parentsâ€™ unwavering support during challenging times. Thank you, Mom and Dad, for everything!</p>
